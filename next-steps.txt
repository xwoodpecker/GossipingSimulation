B2) add crd for simulation services (?)
 -> can include dynamic graph generation (?)
        -> specify generation <-> simulation configuration and workflow

C) Ideas:
- Weighted Algorithm:
    * Memory (todo: test)
    * Probabilities (from comm. detection)
    * Configurable factor (todo: test)

D) document 

Bugfixing/Refactoring:
- simulation properties still not used in runner container app
(done -> todo: test)
- maybe refactor result saving split graph <-> simulation logging and repeated logging (?)
- can refactor algorithm as standalone custom  (?)
