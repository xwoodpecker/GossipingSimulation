A) complete runner logic
    -> runner has to receive graph metadata and add to results (i.e. modularity)

B) add crd for simulation services
 -> specifies repetitons of simulations
 -> can include dynamic graph generation
 -> different properties have to be implemented

C) implement weighted gossiping
 -> detect communities in runner
 -> use very simple approach (higher priority to non-community neighbors)
