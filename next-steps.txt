A) 
- add more logging (json files for round data) (done)
- Bugfixing/Refactoring: ENV VISUALIZE (done)
- Initialization: (done)
    * random node values
    * fixed node values (comparability)
<todo: test>

B1) add repititions to simulation
<todo: test>


B2) add crd for simulation services (?)
 -> can include dynamic graph generation (?)
        -> specify generation <-> simulation configuration and workflow

C) Ideas:
- Weighted Algorithm:
    * Memory
    * Probabilities (from comm. detection)
    * Configurable factor

D) document 


Bugfixing/Refactoring:
- graph properties still not used in runner container app
- maybe refactor result saving split graph <-> simulation logging and repeated logging (?)
