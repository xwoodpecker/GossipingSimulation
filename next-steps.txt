A) complete runner logic
    x 1) runner has to receive graph adj list
    x 2) runner has to generate graphs as images and store them in object storage
    x 3) runner has to store results as json file
    4) runner has to receive graph metadata and add to results (i.e. modularity)
    5) svg animation rendering or fix png rendering 
    add font package:
        * tff-dejavu
        * pango
    

B) add crd for simulation services
 -> specifies repetions of simulations
 -> can include dynamic graph generation
 -> different properties have to be implemented

C) implement weighted gossiping
 -> detect communities in runner
 -> use very simple approach (higher priority to non-community neighbors)
