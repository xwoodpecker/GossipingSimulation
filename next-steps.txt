B2) add crd for simulation services (?)
 -> can include dynamic graph generation (?)
        -> specify generation <-> simulation configuration and workflow
        -> rest api for graph / (simulation) object creation?
        -> cleanup graph generation 
        -> graph generation should be as dynamic as possible
        -> add modular graph creation rountine (github project)

D) document
Prio A:
- grobkonzept bausteinsicht or sth else(?)
- feinkonzept klassendiagramm or sth else (?)

Bugfixing/Refactoring:
*Prio A
- maybe log scale probability values for comm prob alg
- shorten object storage file names in directories (no need for full simulation name)
*Prio B
- refactor classes / subclasses (move to separated files)
- maybe refactor result saving split graph <-> simulation logging and repeated logging (?)
- can refactor algorithm as standalone custom resource (?)
*Prio C
- add comments to lots of stuff
- use logger logic everywhere (?)
- run highlighting in runner/service (separation line or sth idk)
