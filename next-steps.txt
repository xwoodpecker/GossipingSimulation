B2) add crd for simulation services (?)
 -> can include dynamic graph generation (?)
        -> specify generation <-> simulation configuration and workflow

C) Ideas:
- Weighted Algorithm:
    * Memory
    * Probabilities (from comm. detection)
    * Configurable factor

D) document 

Bugfixing/Refactoring:
- graph properties still not used in runner container app
- maybe refactor result saving split graph <-> simulation logging and repeated logging (?)
