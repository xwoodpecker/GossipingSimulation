A) 
- add more logging (json files for round data)
- Bugfixing/Refactoring: ENV VISUALIZE (?)
- Initialization:
    * random node values
    * fixed node values (comparability)


B) add crd for simulation services
 -> specifies repetitons of simulations
 -> can include dynamic graph generation (?)
    better: develop dynamic graph generation logic that creates graph objects
        potentially: rest api that creates graph and simulation objects based on inputs
        simple gui using api to run and inspect simulations (accessing minio)
        -> nono focus on crd and stuff !
 -> different properties have to be implemented 
    params for the algorithm

C)Ideas:
- Weighted Algorithm:
    * Memory
    * Probabilities (from comm. detection)
    * Configurable factor

D) document
