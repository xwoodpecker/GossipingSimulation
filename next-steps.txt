B2) add crd for simulation services (?)
 -> can include dynamic graph generation (?)
        -> specify generation <-> simulation configuration and workflow
        -> rest api for graph / (simulation) object creation?
        -> cleanup graph generation 
        -> graph generation should be as dynamic as possible
        -> add modular graph creation rountine (github project)

xxx C) Ideas:
xxx - Weighted Algorithm:
xxx     * Memory (todo: test)
xxx     * Probabilities (from comm. detection)
xxx     * Configurable factor (todo: test)

D) document 

Bugfixing/Refactoring:
xxx
xxx - simulation properties still not used in runner container app
xxx done -> todo: test
xxx
- maybe refactor result saving split graph <-> simulation logging and repeated logging (?)
- can refactor algorithm as standalone custom  (?)
- refactor all strings/globalvars in one shared class
- print node communities in json file as output
