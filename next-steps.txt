A) complete runner logic
    1) runner has to receive graph adj list
    2) runner has to generate graphs as images and store them in object storage
    3) runner has to store results as json file

B) add crd for simulation services
 -> specifies repetions of simulations
 -> can include dynamic graph generation
 -> different properties have to be implemented

C) implement weighted gossiping
 -> detect communities in runner
 ->
